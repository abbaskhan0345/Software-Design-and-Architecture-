Chain of Responsibility Pattern - Assignment Solution
Assignment Overview
This solution implements the Chain of Responsibility design pattern to process requests through a series of handlers as specified in the assignment requirements.

Implementation Details
1. Request Class
The Request class encapsulates:

Request ID

Data payload

Client IP address

Validation status

Cache status

Response field

2. Handler Implementations
Base Handler
Abstract base class defining the chain structure

Implements the core chain traversal logic

Concrete Handlers:
DataValidationHandler

Validates request data exists

Checks for required fields

Sanitizes input data

IPFilteringHandler

Maintains list of blocked IPs

Rejects requests from blocked addresses

Allows valid IPs to proceed

CachingHandler

Stores successful responses

Returns cached responses when available

Only caches valid, uncached responses

FinalProcessingHandler

Processes only valid, uncached requests

Generates final response

End of the processing chain

3. Chain Setup
The handlers are linked in this sequence:

DataValidation → IPFiltering → Caching → FinalProcessing
4. Test Cases Demonstrated
Three test scenarios are implemented:

Valid Request

Passes all checks

Gets fully processed

Response is cached

Blocked IP Request

Valid data format

From blocked IP address

Rejected by IPFilteringHandler

Cached Request

Duplicate of valid request

Served from cache

Doesn't reach final processor

How to Run
Save the complete code as chain_of_responsibility.py

Execute with Python:

bash
python chain_of_responsibility.py
Key Design Points
Separation of Concerns: Each handler has a single responsibility

Flexible Chain: Handlers can be rearranged or added without modifying existing code

Short-Circuiting: Invalid requests exit the chain early

Extensibility: New handlers can be added easily

Learning Outcomes
This implementation demonstrates:

Practical application of Chain of Responsibility pattern

Proper separation of validation, filtering, and processing logic

Effective use of object-oriented design principles

Clean request processing pipeline architecture

The solution meets all specified assignment requirements while maintaining clean, modular code that could be extended for real-world use cases.
